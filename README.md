Retrospective analysis:


During the development of the team-portfolio-project, the most significant technical challenge we encountered was to maintain synchronization among all the contributors working on different branch especially those working on shared file, and we did it by resolving conflicts and keeping communication.

Specials merge conflicts that grabbed our attentions were when me, the team leader pulled the branch develop into my pc and started making changes, I took a break, and then when I added the files i changed, commited them, then tried to push them and it didn't work because it appeared that of my teammates pushed new change into the branch, so we had a merge conflict because it meant i was working on an old version, to resolve the conflict i had to pull and fetch the branch again, alter some things and then push again, then we had to compare both set of change and resolve the conflict through the signs <<< >>> GitHub offers, we chose to keep both changes and the pull request was then agreed by a collaborator. Then the merge was successful and completed.

The pull request and peer review process played a vital role in improving the final softwareâ€™s quality. Requiring at least one approving review before merging ensured that every modification was inspected by another team member. This helped identify small coding inconsistencies and layout issues. Furthermore, the branch protection rule on main prevented unreviewed or unstable code from being merged directly, thereby maintaining project stability. Overall, the structured use of pull requests, reviews, and collaborative conflict resolution strengthened our understanding of distributed version control and improved the robustness and readability of the final product.
